				<h3>Group Classes</h3>
				<p>Starting a fitness routine can be intimidating, but it helps to have an idea of what to expect before joining any class. Across the communities we serve nationwide, we offer an array of different group fitness class types to meet the dynamic needs of our communities. If you are just starting out with the idea of a group fitness class, keep in mind there is never a one-size-fits all. If you tried one type of class and didn’t love it, there’s probably still another fitness class that might be a game-changer for you. </p>

				<h3>Aquatic Pool</h3>
				<p>You can use aquatic exercise to improve heart health and build muscle. Land-based exercise can cause high-impact strain. But water naturally provides buoyancy, which takes the pressure off joints while providing 360-degree resistance for a total-body workout every time..</p>
